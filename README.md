# Good-Apps
## Overview
This is a dummy web app that I built to learn backend development using django and python. In this project, I learned how to handle HTTP request, build data model representation, manage CRUD operation from user input, and handle AJAX request. The features included in the web app are:

* User authentication
* Create/edit products
* Upvote/deupvote products from home and product page
* add/delete reviews on product page
* like/dislike reviews on product page
